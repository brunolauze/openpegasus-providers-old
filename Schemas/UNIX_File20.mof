          "opaquely and uniquely identify an instance of this class "
          "within the scope of the instantiating Namespace. Various "
          "subclasses of this class may override this property to "
          "make it required, or a key. Such subclasses may also "
          "modify the preferred algorithms for ensuring uniqueness "
          "that are defined below.\n"
          "To ensure uniqueness within the NameSpace, the value of "
          "InstanceID should be constructed using the following "
          "\"preferred\" algorithm: \n"
          "<OrgID>:<LocalID> \n"

          "the business entity that is creating or defining the "
          "InstanceID or that is a registered ID assigned to the "

          "requirement is similar to the <Schema Name>_<Class Name> "
          "structure of Schema class names.) In addition, to ensure "
          "uniqueness, <OrgID> must not contain a colon (:). When "
          "using this algorithm, the first colon to appear in "
          "InstanceID must appear between <OrgID> and <LocalID>. \n"

          "not be reused to identify different underlying "
          "(real-world) elements. If not null and the above "
