       "superclass (or top of the inheritance tree) for the "
       "non-association classes in the CIM Schema." )]

      [Description ( 
          "InstanceID is an optional property that may be used to "
          "opaquely and uniquely identify an instance of this class "
          "within the scope of the instantiating Namespace. Various "
          "subclasses of this class may override this property to "
          "make it required, or a key. Such subclasses may also "
          "modify the preferred algorithms for ensuring uniqueness "
          "that are defined below.\n"
          "To ensure uniqueness within the NameSpace, the value of "
          "InstanceID should be constructed using the following "
          "\"preferred\" algorithm: \n"
          "<OrgID>:<LocalID> \n"

          "the business entity that is creating or defining the "
          "InstanceID or that is a registered ID assigned to the "
          "business entity by a recognized global authority. (This "
          "requirement is similar to the <Schema Name>_<Class Name> "
          "structure of Schema class names.) In addition, to ensure "
          "uniqueness, <OrgID> must not contain a colon (:). When "
          "using this algorithm, the first colon to appear in "
          "InstanceID must appear between <OrgID> and <LocalID>. \n"
          "<LocalID> is chosen by the business entity and should "
          "not be reused to identify different underlying "
          "(real-world) elements. If not null and the above "
          "\"preferred\" algorithm is not used, the defining entity "
          "must assure that the resulting InstanceID is not reused "
          "across any InstanceIDs produced by this or other "
          "providers for the NameSpace of this instance. \n"
          "If not set to null for DMTF-defined instances, the "

   [Abstract, Version ( "2.33.0" ), 
    UMLPackagePath ( "CIM::Core::Settings" ), 
    Description ( 
       "CIM_SettingData is used to represent configuration and and "
       "operational parameters for CIM_ManagedElement instances. There "
       "are a number of different uses of CIM_SettingData supported in "
       "the model today. Additional uses may be defined in the future.\n"
       "Instances of CIM_SettingData may represent Aspects of a "
       "CIM_ManagedElement instance. This is modeled using the "
       "CIM_SettingsDefineState association. CIM_SettingData may be "
       "used to define capabilities when associated to an instance of "
       "CIM_Capabilities through the CIM_SettingsDefineCapabilities "
       "association. \n"
       "Instances of CIM_SettingData may represent different types of "
       "configurations for a CIM_ManagedElement, including persistent "
       "configurations, in progress configuration changes, or "
       "requested configurations. The CIM_ElementSettingData "
       "association is used to model the relationship between a "
       "CIM_SettingData instance and the CIM_ManagedElement for which "
       "it is a configuration. \n"
       "When an instance of CIM_SettingData represents a "
       "configuration, the current operational values for the "
       "parameters of the element are reflected by properties in the "
       "Element itself or by properties in its associations. These "
       "properties do not have to be the same values that are present "
       "in the SettingData object. For example, a modem might have a "
       "SettingData baud rate of 56Kb/sec but be operating at "
       "19.2Kb/sec. \n"
       "Note: The CIM_SettingData class is very similar to "
       "CIM_Setting, yet both classes are present in the model because "
       "many implementations have successfully used CIM_Setting. "
       "However, issues have arisen that could not be resolved without "
       "defining a new class. Therefore, until a new major release "
       "occurs, both classes will exist in the model. Refer to the "
       "Core White Paper for additional information. SettingData "
       "instances can be aggregated together into higher- level "
       "SettingData objects using ConcreteComponent associations." )]
