    Description ( 
       "CIM_SystemComponent is a specialization of the CIM_Component "
       "association that establishes \'part of\' relationships between "
       "a System and any ManagedSystemElements of which it is "
       "composed. \n"
       "Use this association with caution when using it instead of a "
       "subclass such as SystemDevice or a peer association such as "
       "HostedService. This class is very broadly defined, which can "
       "lead to erroneous use. For example, Access Points that are "
       "dependent on (and hosted on) a System are NOT Components of "
       "the System. The System is not made up of any AccessPoint "
       "\'parts\', which is why a Dependency association, "
       "HostedAccessPoint, was defined. Similarly, a PhysicalPackage "
       "is not a \'part\' of a System, because the physical element "
       "exists independently of any internal components, software, and "
       "so on. In fact, again, a Dependency relationship is true where "
       "a ComputerSystem is Dependent on its packaging, as described "
       "by the ComputerSystemPackage association." )]
